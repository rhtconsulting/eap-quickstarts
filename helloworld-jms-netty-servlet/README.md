What is it?
-----------

The `helloworld-jms-netty-servlet` quickstart demonstrates the use of external JMS clients with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform using the Netty Servlet connector. The Netty Servlet connector allows remote JMS traffic to be tunneled over HTTP to a servlet running in JBoss EAP, thus reducing the number of required open network ports on the host.

It contains the following:

1. A message producer that sends messages to a JMS destination deployed to a JBoss EAP server.

2. A message consumer that receives message from a JMS destination deployed to a JBoss EAP server.


System requirements
-------------------

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.x. 

All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or later, Maven 3.0 or later.


Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.


Use of EAP_HOME
---------------

In the following instructions, replace `EAP_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP 6 installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).


Add an Application User
----------------

This quickstart uses secured management interfaces and requires that you create the following application user to access the running application. 

| **UserName** | **Realm** | **Password** | **Roles** |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| quickstartUser| ApplicationRealm | quickstartPwd1!| guest |

To add the application user, open a command prompt and type the following command:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'guest'
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\add-user.bat  -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'guest'

If you prefer, you can use the add-user utility interactively. 
For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see the instructions located here: [Add an Application User](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.md#add-an-application-user).


Configure the JBoss EAP Server
---------------------------

You configure the JMS `test` queue by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into `configure-jms.cli` and `configure-connection-factory.cli` scripts provided in the root directory of this quickstart. 

1. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file
    * If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server.
    * Backup the file: `EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`
    * After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.
2. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing the following: 

        For Linux:  EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows:  EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
3. Review the `configure-jms.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the Netty Servlet acceptor, Netty Servlet connector, and the `test` queue to the `messaging` subsystem in the server configuration file.

4. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing EAP_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: EAP_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-jms.cli 
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-jms.cli 
   You should see the following result when you run the script:

        The batch executed successfully.
        {"outcome" => "success"}

5. Review the `configure-connection-factory.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. This script adds the JMS connection factory that will connect to the Netty Servlet.

6. Run the following command, replacing EAP_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: EAP_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-connection-factory.cli
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-connection-factory.cli 
   You should see the following result when you run the script:

        The batch executed successfully.
        {"outcome" => "success"}

7. Stop the JBoss EAP server.


Review the Modified Server Configuration
-----------------------------------

After stopping the server, open the `EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` file and review the changes.

The following `netty-servlet` connector was configured in the `<connectors>` element in the `messaging` subsystem.

                    <netty-connector name="netty-servlet" socket-binding="http">
                        <param key="use-servlet" value="true"/>
                        <param key="servlet-path" value="/messaging/HornetQServlet"/>
                    </netty-connector>

The following `netty-servlet` acceptor was configured in the `<acceptors>` element in the `messaging` subsystem.

                    <acceptor name="netty-servlet">
                        <factory-class>org.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactory</factory-class>
                        <param key="use-invm" value="true"/>
                        <param key="host" value="org.hornetq"/>
                    </acceptor>

The following `ServletConnectionFactory` connection-factor was configured in the `<jms-connection-factories>` element in the `messaging` subsystem.

                    <connection-factory name="ServletConnectionFactory">
                        <connectors>
                            <connector-ref connector-name="netty-servlet"/>
                        </connectors>
                        <entries>
                            <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/ServletConnectionFactory"/>
                        </entries>
                    </connection-factory>

The following `testQueue` jms-queue was configured in a new `<jms-destinations>` element under the hornetq-server section of the `messaging` subsystem.

      <jms-destinations>
          <jms-queue name="testQueue">
              <entry name="queue/test"/>
              <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/queue/test"/>
          </jms-queue>
      </jms-destinations>


Deploy the Netty Servlet
------------------------

In order for JBoss EAP to receive remote JMS traffic via a servlet, the Netty Servlet application must be deployed. All that is needed to do this is to either 1) enable the servlet via an existing web application that is already deployed to JBoss EAP, or 2) deploy a dedicated application to enable the servlet. This quickstart will use option 2).

1. Inspect the contents of `netty-servlet-deployment/messaging.war` in the root of the quickstart directory.
    1. The Netty Servlet class is found in the `org.jboss.netty` JBoss Module. The application that deploys the Netty Servlet must declare a dependency on this JBoss module. In this quickstart, the dependency is declared in the `WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml` file.
    2. The `WEB-INF/web.xml` declares the url-pattern of the Netty Servlet. This value, combined with the WAR application name, must match the `servlet-path` parameter of the `netty-servlet` connector.

2. Copy all of the contents of the `netty-servlet-deployment` directory to EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments

        For Linux: cp -r netty-servlet-deployment/* EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/

_NOTE_: The `messaging.war.dodeploy` file is required to deploy the exploded messaging.war application.


Start the JBoss EAP Server with the Full Profile
---------------

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:

        For Linux:   EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml


Build and Execute the Quickstart
-------------------------

To run the quickstart from the command line:

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server. See the instructions in the previous section.

2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the helloworld-jms-netty-servlet quickstart directory:

        cd PATH_TO_QUICKSTARTS/helloworld-jms-netty-servlet

3. Type the following command to compile and execute the quickstart:

        mvn clean compile exec:java

 
Investigate the Console Output
-------------------------

If the Maven command is successful, with the default configuration you will see output similar to this:

    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Attempting to acquire connection factory "jms/ServletConnectionFactory"
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Found connection factory "jms/ServletConnectionFactory" in JNDI
    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Attempting to acquire destination "jms/queue/test"

    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.as.quickstarts.jms.HelloWorldJMSClient main
    INFO: Received message with content Hello, World!

_Note_: After the above INFO message, you may see the following error. You can ignore the error as it is a well known error message and does not indicate the Maven command was unsuccessful in any way. 

    Mar 14, 2012 1:38:58 PM org.jboss.naming.remote.protocol.v1.RemoteNamingStoreV1$MessageReceiver handleEnd
    ERROR: Channel end notification received, closing channel Channel ID cd114175 (outbound) of Remoting connection 00392fe8 to localhost/127.0.0.1:4447

    Default: `"localhost"`


Remove the JMS Configuration
----------------------------

You can remove the JMS configuration by running the  `remove-jms.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart or by manually restoring the back-up copy the configuration file. 

### Remove the JMS Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script

1. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing the following: 

        For Linux:  EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
        For Windows:  EAP_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
2. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing EAP_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: EAP_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=remove-jms.cli 
        For Windows: EAP_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=remove-jms.cli 
   This script removes the `test` queue from the `messaging` subsystem in the server configuration. You should see the following result when you run the script:

        The batch executed successfully.
        {"outcome" => "success"}


### Remove the JMS Configuration Manually
1. If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server.
2. Replace the `EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml` file with the back-up copy of the file.
